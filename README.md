World Life Expectancy Analysis üåç

Welcome to the World Life Expectancy Analysis project! In this project, we dive into the fascinating world of global life expectancy trends. Have you ever wondered how factors like GDP, BMI, and health standards impact how long people live in different countries? Let's find out together!

Project Overview
What is this project about?
This project aims to explore and analyze life expectancy trends across various countries around the world. By delving into the data, we uncover interesting insights into how different factors contribute to the life expectancy of populations.

What are we exploring?
Data Cleaning: We begin by ensuring our data is squeaky clean, removing duplicates and correcting any missing values to get a reliable dataset.

Data Analysis: Using SQL queries, we dig into the data to uncover patterns and correlations. We're particularly interested in how GDP, BMI, and other factors relate to life expectancy.

Visualization: Numbers are great, but visuals tell a story. We create captivating graphs and charts to showcase our findings in an easy-to-understand way.

Key Findings
GDP vs. Life Expectancy: We observed a clear correlation between a country's GDP and the life expectancy of its citizens.

BMI Impact: Countries with higher average BMI tend to have lower life expectancies, indicating a potential health trend.

Developed vs. Developing: Uncovering differences in life expectancy between developed and developing nations sheds light on global health disparities.
