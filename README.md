World Life Expectancy Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global life expectancy trends using a dataset containing information about life expectancy, GDP, BMI, and other key factors across different countries and years. The goal was to uncover insights into how these factors correlate with life expectancy and to visualize these trends for better understanding.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about life expectancy, GDP, BMI, and other variables for various countries over multiple years. It was sourced from DataHub and includes data points such as:

Country
Year
Life Expectancy
GDP
BMI
Status (Developed/Developing)
Data Cleaning
Identified and removed duplicate entries based on country and year to ensure data integrity.
Corrected missing values in the 'Status' column by comparing with neighboring years' data.
Filled in missing 'Life Expectancy' values by averaging data from adjacent years.
Ensured consistency and accuracy of the dataset for analysis.
Data Exploration
Calculated the difference in life expectancy over 15 years for each country to understand trends.
Explored the average life expectancy of countries over the years to identify patterns.
Investigated the relationship between average life expectancy and GDP, highlighting correlations.
Compared life expectancy between countries with high and low GDP to draw comparisons.
Examined the average life expectancy based on country status (Developed/Developing) to understand disparities.
Explored the correlation between life expectancy and BMI, revealing interesting insights.
Analyzed the impact of adult mortality on life expectancy trends through rolling total calculations.
Results
Countries with higher GDP tend to have higher average life expectancies, as revealed by the analysis.
Developed countries generally exhibit higher life expectancies compared to developing countries, showcasing disparities.
Lower BMI is associated with higher average life expectancy, a significant finding from the data.
The impact of adult mortality on life expectancy trends was analyzed, providing valuable insights.
